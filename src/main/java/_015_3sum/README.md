# Problem

Given an array _S_ of _n_ integers, are there elements _a_, _b_, _c_ in _S_
such that _a_ + _b_ + _c_ = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which
gives the sum of zero.

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
    ```
    For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],
    A solution set is:
    [
      [-1, 0, 1],
      [-1, -1, 2]
    ]
    ```
