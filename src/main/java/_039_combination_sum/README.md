# Problem

Given a **set** of candidate numbers (**_C_**) **(without duplicates)** and a
target number (**_T_**), find all unique combinations in **_C_** where the
candidate numbers sums to **_T_**.

The **same** repeated number may be chosen from **_C_** unlimited number of
times.

**Note:**  

  * All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
  * The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

For example, given candidate set `[2, 3, 6, 7]` and target `7`,

A solution set is:

    ```
    [
      [7],
      [2, 2, 3]
    ]
    ```
