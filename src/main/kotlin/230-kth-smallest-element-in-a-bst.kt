/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**th
 * smallest element in it.
 * 
 * **Note: **  
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ? k ? BST's total elements.
 * 
 * **Follow up:**  
 * What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to
 * find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest
 * routine?
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to [@ts](https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/ts) for adding this
 * problem and creating all test cases.
