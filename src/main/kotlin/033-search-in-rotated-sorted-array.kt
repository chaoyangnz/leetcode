/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to
 * you beforehand.
 * 
 * (i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).
 * 
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its
 * index, otherwise return -1.
 * 
 * You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
 * 
 * [Subscribe](/subscribe/) to see which companies asked this question.
