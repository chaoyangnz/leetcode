/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a string _s1_, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it
 * to two non-empty substrings recursively.
 * 
 * Below is one possible representation of _s1_ = `"great"`:
 * 
 * To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two
 * children.
 * 
 * For example, if we choose the node `"gr"` and swap its two children, it
 * produces a scrambled string `"rgeat"`.
 * 
 * We say that `"rgeat"` is a scrambled string of `"great"`.
 * 
 * Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes `"eat"` and `"at"`, it
 * produces a scrambled string `"rgtae"`.
 * 
 * We say that `"rgtae"` is a scrambled string of `"great"`.
 * 
 * Given two strings _s1_ and _s2_ of the same length, determine if _s2_ is a
 * scrambled string of _s1_.
