 * Solution

 * Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters
 * from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom
 * note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.
 * 
 * Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.
 * 
 * **Note:**  
 * You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.
