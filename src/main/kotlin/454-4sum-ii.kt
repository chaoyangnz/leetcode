/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples `(i, j,
 * k, l)` there are such that `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l]` is zero.
 * 
 * To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤ N
 * ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -228 to 228 - 1 and the result is
 * guaranteed to be at most 231 - 1.
 * 
 * **Example:**
 * 
 * [Subscribe](/subscribe/) to see which companies asked this question.
