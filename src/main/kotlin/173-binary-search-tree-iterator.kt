import org.junit.*

/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be
 * initialized with the root node of a BST.
 * 
 * Calling `next()` will return the next smallest number in the BST.
 * 
 * **Note: **`next()` and `hasNext()` should run in average O(1) time and uses O(_h_) memory, where _h_ is the height of the tree. 
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to [@ts](https://oj.leetcode.com/discuss/user/ts) for adding
 * this problem and creating all test cases.
