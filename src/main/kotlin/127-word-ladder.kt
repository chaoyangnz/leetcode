/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given two words (_beginWord_ and _endWord_), and a dictionary's word list,
 * find the length of shortest transformation sequence from _beginWord_ to
 * _endWord_, such that:
 * 
 *   1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
 *   2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that _beginWord_ is _not_ a transformed word.
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * Given:
 * 
 * _beginWord_ = `"hit"`
 * 
 * _endWord_ = `"cog"`
 * 
 * _wordList_ = `["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]`
 * 
 * As one shortest transformation is `"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"`,
 * 
 * return its length `5`.
 * 
 * **Note:**  
 * 
 *   * Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
 *   * All words have the same length.
 *   * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
 *   * You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
 *   * You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.
 * 
 * **UPDATE (2017/1/20):**  
 * The _wordList_ parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a
 * set of strings). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.
