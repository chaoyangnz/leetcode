/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of range sums that lie in
 * `[lower, upper]` inclusive.
 * 
 * Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between
 * indices `i` and `j` (`i` â‰¤ `j`), inclusive.
 * 
 * **Note:**  
 * A naive algorithm of _O_(_n_2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
 * 
 * **Example:**  
 * Given _nums_ = `[-2, 5, -1]`, _lower_ = `-2`, _upper_ = `2`,
 * 
 * Return `3`.
 * 
 * The three ranges are : `[0, 0]`, `[2, 2]`, `[0, 2]` and their respective sums
 * are: `-2, -1, 2`.
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to [@dietpepsi](https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/dietpepsi)
 * for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
