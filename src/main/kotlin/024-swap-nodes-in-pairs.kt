/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * Given `1->2->3->4`, you should return the list as `2->1->4->3`.
 * 
 * Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may **not** modify the
 * values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.
