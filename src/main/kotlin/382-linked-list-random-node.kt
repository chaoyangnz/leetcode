/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list.
 * Each node must have the **same probability** of being chosen.
 * 
 * **Follow up:**  
 * What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you?
 * Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?
 * 
 * **Example:**
 * 
 * [Subscribe](/subscribe/) to see which companies asked this question.
