# Problem

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is
described by a pair of integers `(h, k)`, where `h` is the height of the
person and `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a
height greater than or equal to `h`. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the
queue.

**Note:**  
The number of people is less than 1,100.
