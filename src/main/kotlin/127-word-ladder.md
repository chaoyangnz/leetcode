# Problem

Given two words (_beginWord_ and _endWord_), and a dictionary's word list,
find the length of shortest transformation sequence from _beginWord_ to
_endWord_, such that:

For example,

Given:

_beginWord_ = `"hit"`

_endWord_ = `"cog"`

_wordList_ = `["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]`

As one shortest transformation is `"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"`,

return its length `5`.

**Note:**  

**UPDATE (2017/1/20):**  
The _wordList_ parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a
set of strings). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.
