import org.junit.*

/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1'
 * bits it has (also known as the [Hamming
 * weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).
 * 
 * For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation
 * `00000000000000000000000000001011`, so the function should return 3.
 *

 * this problem and creating all test cases.
