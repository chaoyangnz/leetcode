# Problem

You are given an array _x_ of `n` positive numbers. You start at point `(0,0)`
and moves `x[0]` metres to the north, then `x[1]` metres to the west, `x[2]`
metres to the south, `x[3]` metres to the east and so on. In other words,
after each move your direction changes counter-clockwise.

Write a one-pass algorithm with `O(1)` extra space to determine, if your path
crosses itself, or not.

**Example 1:**  

**Example 2:**  

**Example 3:**
