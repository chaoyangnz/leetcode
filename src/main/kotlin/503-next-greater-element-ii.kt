/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first
 * element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The
 * Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its
 * traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to
 * find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.
 * 
 * **Example 1:**  
 * 
 * **Note:** The length of given array won't exceed 10000.
