# Problem

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only
one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has
one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that
"all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact
the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without
alerting the police.

**Example 1:**
