/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the
 * number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.
 * 
 * **Example:**
 *     ```
 *     _**nums**_ = [1, 2, 3]
 *     _**target**_ = 4
 *     The possible combination ways are:
 *     (1, 1, 1, 1)
 *     (1, 1, 2)
 *     (1, 2, 1)
 *     (1, 3)
 *     (2, 1, 1)
 *     (2, 2)
 *     (3, 1)
 *     Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
 *     Therefore the output is _**7**_.
 *     ```
 * 
 * **Follow up:**  
 * What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
 * 
 * How does it change the problem?
 * 
 * What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to [@pbrother](https://leetcode.com/pbrother/) for adding this
 * problem and creating all test cases.
