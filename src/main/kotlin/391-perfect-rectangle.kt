 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given N axis-aligned rectangles where N > 0, determine if they all together
 * form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
 * 
 * Each rectangle is represented as a bottom-left point and a top-right point.
 * For example, a unit square is represented as [1,1,2,2]. (coordinate of bottom-
 * left point is (1, 1) and top-right point is (2, 2)).
