/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Compare two version numbers _version1_ and _version2_.
 * 
 * If _version1_ > _version2_ return 1, if _version1_ < _version2_ return -1,
 * otherwise return 0.
 * 
 * You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits
 * and the `.` character.
 * 
 * The `.` character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate
 * number sequences.
 * 
 * For instance, `2.5` is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it
 * is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.
 * 
 * Here is an example of version numbers ordering:
