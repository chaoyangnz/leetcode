# Problem

Given _n_, how many structurally unique **BST's** (binary search trees) that
store values 1..._n_?

For example,

Given _n_ = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.

    ```
       1         3     3      2      1
        \       /     /      / \      \
         3     2     1      1   3      2
        /     /       \                 \
       2     1         2                 3
    ```
