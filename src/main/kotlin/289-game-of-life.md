According to the [Wikipedia's
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game
of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by
the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a _board_ with _m_ by _n_ cells, each cell has an initial state _live_
(1) or _dead_ (0). Each cell interacts with its [eight
neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal,
vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above
Wikipedia article):

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board
given its current state.
