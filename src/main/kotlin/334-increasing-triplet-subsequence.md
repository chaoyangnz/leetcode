# Problem

Given an unsorted array return whether an increasing subsequence of length 3
exists or not in the array.

Formally the function should:

Your algorithm should run in O(_n_) time complexity and O(_1_) space
complexity.

**Examples:**  
Given `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`,

return `true`.

Given `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`,

return `false`.
