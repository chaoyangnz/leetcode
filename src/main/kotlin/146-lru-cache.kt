/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Design and implement a data structure for [Least Recently Used (LRU)
 * cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU). It
 * should support the following operations: `get` and `put`.
 * 
 * `get(key)` - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key
 * exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
 * 
 * `put(key, value)` - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present.
 * When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently
 * used item before inserting a new item.
 * 
 * **Follow up:**  
 * Could you do both operations in **O(1)** time complexity?
 * 
 * **Example:**
 * 
 * [Subscribe](/subscribe/) to see which companies asked this question.
