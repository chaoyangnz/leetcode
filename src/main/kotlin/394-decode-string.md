# Problem

Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the _encoded_string_ inside
the square brackets is being repeated exactly _k_ times. Note that _k_ is
guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces,
square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits
and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, _k_. For example, there
won't be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.
