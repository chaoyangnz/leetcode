/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
 * 
 * **Example:**  
 * Given _nums1_ = `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, _nums2_ = `[2, 2]`, return `[2, 2]`.
 * 
 * **Note:**  
 * 
 *   * Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
 *   * The result can be in any order.
 * 
 * **Follow up:**  
 * 
 *   * What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
 *   * What if _nums1_'s size is small compared to _nums2_'s size? Which algorithm is better?
 *   * What if elements of _nums2_ are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
 *
