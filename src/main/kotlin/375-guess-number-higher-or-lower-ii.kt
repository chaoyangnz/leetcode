/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 * 
 * I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.
 * 
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is
 * higher or lower.
 * 
 * However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay
 * **$x**. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
 * 
 * **Example:**
 * 
 * Given a particular **n â‰¥ 1**, find out how much money you need to have to
 * guarantee a **win**.
 *
