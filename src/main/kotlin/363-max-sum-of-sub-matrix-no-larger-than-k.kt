/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a non-empty 2D matrix _matrix_ and an integer _k_, find the max sum of a
 * rectangle in the _matrix_ such that its sum is no larger than _k_.
 * 
 * **Example:**  
 * 
 *     ```
 *     Given matrix = [
 *       [1,  0, 1],
 *       [0, -2, 3]
 *     ]
 *     k = 2
 *     ```
 * 
 * The answer is `2`. Because the sum of rectangle `[[0, 1], [-2, 3]]` is 2 and 2
 * is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
 * 
 * **Note:**  
 * 
 *   1. The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
 *   2. What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to [@fujiaozhu](https://discuss.leetcode.com/user/fujiaozhu)
 * for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
