/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a non-empty 2D matrix _matrix_ and an integer _k_, find the max sum of a
 * rectangle in the _matrix_ such that its sum is no larger than _k_.
 * 
 * **Example:**  
 * 
 * The answer is `2`. Because the sum of rectangle `[[0, 1], [-2, 3]]` is 2 and 2
 * is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
 *
