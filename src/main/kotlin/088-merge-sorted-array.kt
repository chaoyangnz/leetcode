/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given two sorted integer arrays _nums1_ and _nums2_, merge _nums2_ into
 * _nums1_ as one sorted array.
 * 
 * **Note:**  
 * You may assume that _nums1_ has enough space (size that is greater or equal to
 * _m_ + _n_) to hold additional elements from _nums2_. The number of elements
 * initialized in _nums1_ and _nums2_ are _m_ and _n_ respectively.
