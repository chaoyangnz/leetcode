# Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of range sums that lie in
`[lower, upper]` inclusive.

Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between
indices `i` and `j` (`i` â‰¤ `j`), inclusive.

**Note:**  
A naive algorithm of _O_(_n_2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

**Example:**  
Given _nums_ = `[-2, 5, -1]`, _lower_ = `-2`, _upper_ = `2`,

Return `3`.

The three ranges are : `[0, 0]`, `[2, 2]`, `[0, 2]` and their respective sums
are: `-2, -1, 2`.
