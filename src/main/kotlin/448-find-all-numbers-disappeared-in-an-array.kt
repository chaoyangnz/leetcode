/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ _n_ (_n_ = size of array), some
 * elements appear twice and others appear once.
 * 
 * Find all the elements of [1, _n_] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
 * 
 * Could you do it without extra space and in O(_n_) runtime? You may assume the
 * returned list does not count as extra space.
 * 
 * **Example:**
 * 
 * [Subscribe](/subscribe/) to see which companies asked this question.
