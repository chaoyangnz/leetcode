# Problem

Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or
down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-
around is not allowed).

**Example 1:**

Return `4`

The longest increasing path is `[1, 2, 6, 9]`.

**Example 2:**

Return `4`

The longest increasing path is `[3, 4, 5, 6]`. Moving diagonally is not
allowed.
