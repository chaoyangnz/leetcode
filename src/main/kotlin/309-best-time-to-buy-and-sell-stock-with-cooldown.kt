/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Say you have an array for which the _i_th element is the price of a given
 * stock on day _i_.
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many
 * transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple
 * times) with the following restrictions:
 * 
 *   * You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 *   * After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
 * 
 * **Example:**  
 * 
 *     ```
 *     prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
 *     maxProfit = 3
 *     transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
 *     ```
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to [@dietpepsi](https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/dietpepsi)
 * for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
