/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum.
 * The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed
 * by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the
 * most frequent subtree sum value? If there is a tie, return all the values with
 * the highest frequency in any order.
 * 
 * **Examples 1**  
 * Input:
 * 
 * **Examples 2**  
 * Input:
 * 
 * **Note:** You may assume the sum of values in any subtree is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
