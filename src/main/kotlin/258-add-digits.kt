/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a non-negative integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the
 * result has only one digit.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * Given `num = 38`, the process is like: `3 + 8 = 11`, `1 + 1 = 2`. Since `2`
 * has only one digit, return it.
 * 
 * **Follow up:**  
 * Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to
 * [@jianchao.li.fighter](https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/jianchao.li.fighter)
 * for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
