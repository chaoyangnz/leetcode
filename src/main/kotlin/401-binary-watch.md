# Problem

A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the **hours** (**0-11**),
and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the **minutes** (**0-59**).

Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the
right.

For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".

Given a non-negative integer _n_ which represents the number of LEDs that are
currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.
