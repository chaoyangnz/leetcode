 * Solution
 * ---
 * Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to
 * _n_.
 * 
 * But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and
 * for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of
 * both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.
 * 
 * **Example:**
 * 
 * [Subscribe](/subscribe/) to see which companies asked this question.
