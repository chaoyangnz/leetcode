# Problem

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is
higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay
**$x**. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

**Example:**

Given a particular **n â‰¥ 1**, find out how much money you need to have to
guarantee a **win**.
