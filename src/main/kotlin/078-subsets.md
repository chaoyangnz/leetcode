# Problem

Given a set of **distinct** integers, _nums_, return all possible subsets.

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. 

For example,

If **_nums_** = `[1,2,3]`, a solution is:

    ```
    [
      [3],
      [1],
      [2],
      [1,2,3],
      [1,3],
      [2,3],
      [1,2],
      []
    ]
    ```
