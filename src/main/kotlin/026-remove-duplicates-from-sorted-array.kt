/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element
 * appear only _once_ and return the new length.
 * 
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with
 * constant memory.
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * Given input array _nums_ = `[1,1,2]`,
 * 
 * Your function should return length = `2`, with the first two elements of
 * _nums_ being `1` and `2` respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond
 * the new length.
