# Problem

The set `[1,2,3,â€¦,_n_]` contains a total of _n_! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,

We get the following sequence (ie, for _n_ = 3):

Given _n_ and _k_, return the _k_th permutation sequence.

**Note:** Given _n_ will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
