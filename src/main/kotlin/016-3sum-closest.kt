/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given an array _S_ of _n_ integers, find three integers in _S_ such that the
 * sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three
 * integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 * 
 *     ```
 *         For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
 *         The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
 *     ```
