/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Find the length of the longest substring **_T_** of a given string (consists
 * of lowercase letters only) such that every character in **_T_** appears no
 * less than _k_ times.
 * 
 * **Example 1:**
 *     ```
 *     Input:
 *     s = "aaabb", k = 3
 *     Output:
 *     3
 *     The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
 *     ```
 * 
 * **Example 2:**
 *     ```
 *     Input:
 *     s = "ababbc", k = 2
 *     Output:
 *     5
 *     The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
 *     ```
