 * Solution
 * ---
 * The set `[1,2,3,â€¦,_n_]` contains a total of _n_! unique permutations.
 * 
 * By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
 * 
 * We get the following sequence (ie, for _n_ = 3):
 * 
 * Given _n_ and _k_, return the _k_th permutation sequence.
 * 
 * **Note:** Given _n_ will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
