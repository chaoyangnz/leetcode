/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a `pattern` and a string `str`, find if `str` follows the same pattern.
 * 
 * Here **follow** means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a
 * letter in `pattern` and a **non-empty** word in `str`.
 * 
 * **Examples:**  
 * 
 * **Notes:**  
 * You may assume `pattern` contains only lowercase letters, and `str` contains
 * lowercase letters separated by a single space.
 *
