/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
 * 
 * A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any
 * positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
 * and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it
 * loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which
 * this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
 * 
 * **Example: **19 is a happy number
 *
