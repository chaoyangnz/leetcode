/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` (the **letter** O), capture all
 * regions surrounded by `'X'`.
 * 
 * A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded
 * region.
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 *     ```
 *     X X X X
 *     X O O X
 *     X X O X
 *     X O X X
 *     ```
 * 
 * After running your function, the board should be:
 * 
 *     ```
 *     X X X X
 *     X X X X
 *     X X X X
 *     X O X X
 *     ```
