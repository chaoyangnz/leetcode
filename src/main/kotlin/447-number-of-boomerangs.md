# Problem

Given _n_ points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is
a tuple of points `(i, j, k)` such that the distance between `i` and `j`
equals the distance between `i` and `k` (**the order of the tuple matters**).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that _n_ will be at most **500**
and coordinates of points are all in the range **[-10000, 10000]**
(inclusive).
