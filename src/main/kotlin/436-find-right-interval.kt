/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an
 * interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the
 * interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.
 * 
 * For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which
 * means that the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right"
 * relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for the
 * interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an
 * array.
 *
