import org.junit.*

/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Find the **k**th largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth
 * largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * Given `[3,2,1,5,6,4]` and k = 2, return 5.
 * 
 * **Note: **  
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to [@mithmatt](https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/mithmatt) for
 * adding this problem and creating all test cases.
