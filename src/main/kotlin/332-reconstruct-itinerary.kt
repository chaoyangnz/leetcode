/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival
 * airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets
 * belong to a man who departs from `JFK`. Thus, the itinerary must begin with
 * `JFK`.
 * 
 * **Note:**  
 * 
 * **Example 1:**  
 * `tickets` = `[["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]`
 * 
 * Return `["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]`.
 * 
 * **Example 2:**  
 * `tickets` =
 * `[["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]`
 * 
 * Return `["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]`.
 * 
 * Another possible reconstruction is `["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]`.
 * But it is larger in lexical order.
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to [@dietpepsi](https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/dietpepsi)
 * for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
