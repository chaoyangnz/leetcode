 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the
 * length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
 * 
 * This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome
 * here.
 * 
 * **Note:**  
 * Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.
 * 
 * **Example: **
 * 
 * [Subscribe](/subscribe/) to see which companies asked this question.
