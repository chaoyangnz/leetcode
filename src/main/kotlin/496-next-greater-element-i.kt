/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * You are given two arrays **(without duplicates)** `nums1` and `nums2` where
 * `nums1`â€™s elements are subset of `nums2`. Find all the next greater numbers
 * for `nums1`'s elements in the corresponding places of `nums2`.
 * 
 * The Next Greater Number of a number **x** in `nums1` is the first greater
 * number to its right in `nums2`. If it does not exist, output -1 for this
 * number.
 * 
 * **Example 1:**  
 * 
 * **Example 2:**
