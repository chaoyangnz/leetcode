# Problem

Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, a 132 pattern is a subsequence
a**i**, a**j**, a**k** such that **i** < **j** < **k** and a**i** < a**k** <
a**j**. Design an algorithm that takes a list of n numbers as input and checks
whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.

**Note:** n will be less than 15,000.

**Example 1:**  

**Example 2:**  

**Example 3:**
