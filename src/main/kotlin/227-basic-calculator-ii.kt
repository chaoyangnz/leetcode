/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.
 * 
 * The expression string contains only **non-negative** integers, `+`, `-`, `*`,
 * `/` operators and empty spaces ` `. The integer division should truncate
 * toward zero.
 * 
 * You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
 * 
 * Some examples:
 * 
 * **Note:** **Do not** use the `eval` built-in library function. 
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to [@ts](https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/ts) for adding this
 * problem and creating all test cases.
 * 
 * [Subscribe](/subscribe/) to see which companies asked this question.
