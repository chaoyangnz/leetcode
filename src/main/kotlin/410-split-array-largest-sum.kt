 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer _m_, you
 * can split the array into _m_ non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an
 * algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these _m_ subarrays.
 * 
 * **Note:**  
 * If _n_ is the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:
