# Problem

Given a collection of candidate numbers (**_C_**) and a target number
(**_T_**), find all unique combinations in **_C_** where the candidate numbers
sums to **_T_**.

Each number in **_C_** may only be used **once** in the combination.

**Note:**  

  * All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
  * The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

For example, given candidate set `[10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5]` and target `8`,

A solution set is:

    ```
    [
      [1, 7],
      [1, 2, 5],
      [2, 6],
      [1, 1, 6]
    ]
    ```
