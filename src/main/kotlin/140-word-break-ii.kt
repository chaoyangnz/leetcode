/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given a **non-empty** string _s_ and a dictionary _wordDict_ containing a list
 * of **non-empty** words, add spaces in _s_ to construct a sentence where each
 * word is a valid dictionary word. You may assume the dictionary does not
 * contain duplicate words.
 * 
 * Return all such possible sentences.
 * 
 * For example, given
 * 
 * _s_ = `"catsanddog"`,
 * 
 * _dict_ = `["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]`.
 * 
 * A solution is `["cats and dog", "cat sand dog"]`.
 * 
 * **UPDATE (2017/1/4):**  
 * The _wordDict_ parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a
 * set of strings). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.
 *
