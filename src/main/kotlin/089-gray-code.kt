/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in
 * only one bit.
 * 
 * Given a non-negative integer _n_ representing the total number of bits in the
 * code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
 * 
 * For example, given _n_ = 2, return `[0,1,3,2]`. Its gray code sequence is:
 * 
 * **Note:**  
 * For a given _n_, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.
 * 
 * For example, `[0,2,3,1]` is also a valid gray code sequence according to the
 * above definition.
 * 
 * For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code
 * sequence. Sorry about that.
 *
