import org.junit.*

/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing
 * subsequence.
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * Given `[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]`,
 * 
 * The longest increasing subsequence is `[2, 3, 7, 101]`, therefore the length
 * is `4`. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only
 * necessary for you to return the length.
 * 
 * Your algorithm should run in O(_n2_) complexity.
 * 
 * **Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(_n_ log _n_) time complexity? 
 * 
 * **Credits:**  
 * Special thanks to [@pbrother](https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/pbrother) for
 * adding this problem and creating all test cases.
