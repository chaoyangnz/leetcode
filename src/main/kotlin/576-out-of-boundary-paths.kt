/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * There is an **m** by **n** grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate
 * **(i,j)** of the ball, you can move the ball to **adjacent** cell or cross the
 * grid boundary in four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can
 * **at most** move **N** times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball
 * out of grid boundary. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 +
 * 7.
 * 
 * **Example 1:**  
 * 
 * **Example 2:**  
 *
