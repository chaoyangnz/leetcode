/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * We define a harmonious array is an array where the difference between its
 * maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** 1.
 * 
 * Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest
 * harmonious subsequence among all its possible
 * [subsequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence).
 * 
 * **Example 1:**  
 * 
 * **Note:** The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.
