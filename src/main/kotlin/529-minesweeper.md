Let's play the minesweeper game
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)), [online
game](http://minesweeperonline.com))!

You are given a 2D char matrix representing the game board. **'M'** represents
an **unrevealed** mine, **'E'** represents an **unrevealed** empty square,
**'B'** represents a **revealed** blank square that has no adjacent (above,
below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals) mines, **digit** ('1' to '8')
represents how many mines are adjacent to this **revealed** square, and
finally **'X'** represents a **revealed** mine.

Now given the next click position (row and column indices) among all the
**unrevealed** squares ('M' or 'E'), return the board after revealing this
position according to the following rules:

**Example 1:**  

**Example 2:**
