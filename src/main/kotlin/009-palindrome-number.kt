/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
 * 
 * click to show spoilers.
 * 
 * Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
 * 
 * If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction
 * of using extra space.
 * 
 * You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the
 * problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow.
 * How would you handle such case?
 * 
 * There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
