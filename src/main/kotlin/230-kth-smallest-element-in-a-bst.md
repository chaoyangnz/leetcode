# Problem

Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**th
smallest element in it.

**Note: **  
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ? k ? BST's total elements.

**Follow up:**  
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to
find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest
routine?
