/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * There are some trees, where each tree is represented by (x,y) coordinate in a
 * two-dimensional garden. Your job is to fence the entire garden using the
 * **minimum length** of rope as it is expensive. The garden is well fenced only
 * if all the trees are enclosed. Your task is to help find the coordinates of
 * trees which are exactly located on the fence perimeter.
 * 
 * **Example 1:**  
 * 
 * **Example 2:**
