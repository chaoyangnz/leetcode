# Problem

Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be
integers or other lists.

**Example 1:**  
Given the list `[[1,1],2,[1,1]]`,

By calling _next_ repeatedly until _hasNext_ returns false, the order of
elements returned by _next_ should be: `[1,1,2,1,1]`.

**Example 2:**  
Given the list `[1,[4,[6]]]`,

By calling _next_ repeatedly until _hasNext_ returns false, the order of
elements returned by _next_ should be: `[1,4,6]`.
