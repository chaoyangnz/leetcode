/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * Given an `m x n` matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of
 * each unit cell in a continent, the "Pacific ocean" touches the left and top
 * edges of the matrix and the "Atlantic ocean" touches the right and bottom
 * edges.
 * 
 * Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell
 * to another one with height equal or lower.
 * 
 * Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and
 * Atlantic ocean.
 * 
 * **Note:**
