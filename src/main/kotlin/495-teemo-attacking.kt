/**
 * Solution
 * ---
 * In LLP world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his
 * enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking
 * **ascending** time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per
 * Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned
 * condition.
 * 
 * You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time
 * point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.
 * 
 * **Example 1:**  
 * 
 * **Example 2:**
