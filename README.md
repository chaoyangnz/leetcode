Leetcode solutions with Kotlin and Java. 

(Specially useful for some new graduates or job hunters targeting to tech gaint in Silicon Valley)

These solutions are from my independent thought. __I pay more attention to the thought process and how a solution is derived.__

## How to know which has a solution

Go to `/src/main/java`, see the commit message, if it is `done`, that means it is resolved and has a good explanation of what is the solution and how the solution is derived.
